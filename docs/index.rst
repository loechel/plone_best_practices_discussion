==================================
Discussion on Plone Best Practices
==================================

This Package is a Placeholder / Backlog of Ideas and Concepts we want to discuss and afterwards move to general Documentation / Trainings Documentation or specific Documentations of Packages or Development Setups like buildout.coredev.

Mission Statement
=================

Plone currently have a set of **Best Practices** that should be used when develop Plone Add'ons or Plone Core Packages.
Those **Best Practices** did conflict in some cases with up to date Python Best Practices and neccessary changes to support multiple Python and Plone Versions.

Therefore this Repository is a platform to discuss tools, code snippets and conventions.
Elements the community have agreed on, should be moved / implemented in plonecli / bobtemplates.plone and the buildout.coredev.

This is a deliverable of `PLIP: TOX as new standard test invocation tool in Plone and Plone guidelines (#2072)  <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/2072>`_.
